I plan to create some applications using Amazon Alexa Service.
# ClashRoyaleHelper
Clash Royale Helper responds to user's query on the cards of Clash Royale with the helper of Amazon Lambda Function.  
Alexa will responds with a detailed description on that card.  
For example, user can say "Alexa, can you tell me something about a knight?"  
Alexa will answers "A tough melee fighter. The Barbarian's handsome, cultured cousin. Rumor has it that he was knighted based on the sheer awesomeness of his mustache alone."

Portugal Soccer Squad helper responds to user's query on the player's bio in Portugal Men's National Soccer Team in EURO 2016.  
Alexa will responds with a short bio on that player.  
For example, user can say "Alexa, can you tell me something about Cristiano Ronaldo?"
Alexa will answers "From Real Madrid, 126 appearance in Portugal National Team with 58 goals. Is this his last major international tournament? It is possible – meaning France could be a final chance to replicate his club success on the international stage. His struggle so far is hardly down to his lack of goals: he broke Portugal’s scoring record two years ago and will surely set a tally unlikely to be matched. However, he often feels the effects of a long club season, and was again a late arrival in the squad due to the Champions League final. Spent last season launching more official products, including new CR7 underpants, and In 2008 revealed he enjoys playing bingo with a bingo DVD. "It can be very exciting because you can be there waiting for a long time for just the one number to make the game complete," he explained. 'Then you see one of your friends get his lucky number before you. I like it.'"
