I plan to create some applications using Amazon Alexa Service.
# ClashRoyaleHelper
ClashRoyaleHelper responds to user's query on the cards of Clash Royale.  
Alexa will responds with a detailed description on that card.  
For example, user can say "Alexa, can you tell me something about a knight?", Alexa will answers "A tough melee fighter. The Barbarian's handsome, cultured cousin. Rumor has it that he was knighted based on the sheer awesomeness of his mustache alone."
